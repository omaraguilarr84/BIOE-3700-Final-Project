# BIOE-3700-Final-Project
This is a repository for our final bioinstrumentation project called CallSense. The device is made for people who are apart of the deaf/hard of hearing community. CallSense is a wearable device that will be able to sense whenever the user's name is called and stimulate a vibration in the direction of that stimulus.
